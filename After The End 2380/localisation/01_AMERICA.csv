BM_FREEDOM_SHALL_NOT_PERISH_DESC;In the great cities of Old America, marble ruins stand as monuments to the gods that once carved purple mountain majesties and raised alabaster cities across this great land. When Bannister Smithson was elected President of the American faithful, many truly believed he would reunite the continent under the one true Flag. The Amish Keynich slaughtered him in battle one and a half years ago. Scattered and divided, the Americanists must now hang together, or they will assuredly hang separately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_3789005;Bannister Smithson was known to prefer the company of men. He died childless. At the age of 12, his closest living relative was elected to succeed him to the seat of Columbia. Great things are expected of young Filibuster, but he faces ambitious judges within his realm and vengeful enemies without.  With the Deitsch to the north and the Confederates to the south, it will be no easy task to live up to his great-uncle's legacy. Can he pass every challenge, or is his path forever obstructed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3788000;The Occultist Kings of New England have long threatened Gotham's independence. Darius Wayne had hoped President Smithson would prove strong enough to destroy New England. He funded Smithson's war against Deitscherei, promising his daughter to Bannister's nephew, and watched as his investment turned to smoke upon Bannister's death. Disillusioned with Columbia, Darius instead wed his daughter to Ellis Rodham, who used House Wayne's gold to fund an army that just might be powerful enough to liberate Hudsonia from the Occultists. If the invasion succeeds, House Wayne will secure a powerful ally, but don't get too comfortable. Your fellow patricians are a veritable rogues' gallery, and all-too-willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_666102;Ned Pitchstone avenged President Smithson's murder and bloodied the Keynich's nose. In Washington he assumed the Presidency, and many hoped he would stay to unite the Midwest and the East, but rising tensions among Catholics and Sioux in his homeland forced his leave. Now his daughter is almost of age. Can Ned defy the odds and resurrect Smithson's dream of one nation under the Flag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_666103;Chicago, the Great American City, was laid low by the Cross. The rust-worshipper Cyrus Boystown slew the quibbling Christians and instituted a reign of terror. With a shrewd mind and a silver tongue, Stanislaus Avondale brought peace to this troubled city, and established a republic in the old American fashion. The Windy City faces intense religious opposition among its neighbors and its own patricians, and Stanislaus has an eye on the Presidency itself. With Americanists, Rust Cultists, Catholics, Mormons, and more, can you keep Chicago from falling into chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
